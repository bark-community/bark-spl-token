## Getting Started

### Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Anchor Framework](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor)

### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the program / project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bark-community/bark-spl-token.git
cd bark-spl-token && programs
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
cargo build
```

### Deploying BARK Token

1. **Initialize the Token**:
   - Adjust parameters in `initialize` function call in `lib.rs` to set initial supply and token decimals.
   - Deploy using Solana CLI or Anchor CLI.

2. **Interacting with BARK Token**:
   - Use provided CLI tools or integrate with Solana wallet apps.
   - See `examples` directory for usage examples.

## Usage

### Interacting with BARK Token

To interact with BARK Token, follow these steps:

1. **Transfer Tokens**:

```bash
solana transfer <recipient_address> <amount>
```

2. **Burn Tokens**:

```bash
solana burn <amount>
```

3. **Mint Tokens**:

```bash
solana mint <recipient_address> <amount>
```

### API Reference

Explore detailed API usage in [Documentation](./docs/API.md).

## Advanced Topics

### Caching and Concurrency

- BARK token utilizes a HashMap cache for balances with RwLock for concurrency control.
- Ensure proper locking mechanisms to maintain data integrity.

### Security Considerations

- Validate inputs to prevent unauthorized transactions and ensure data consistency.
- Regularly audit the token program code for vulnerabilities.
